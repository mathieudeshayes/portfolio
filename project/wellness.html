  <h2>How technology pushes people to commit to a healthier lifestyle</h2>
</br>
  <p>The health and wellness industry has been experiencing immense disruption due to advancements in technology.</p>
  <p>We could think of such a phenomenon as counting your daily steps, to be relatively new. The first pedometer was invented by Abraham-Louis Perrelet in Switzerland in 1780 and it could measure the steps and distance while walking. We had to wait for 1965 and the “manpo-Kei” (which means “10 000 steps meter” in Japanese) to take this measure as a worldwide standard. This metric is still used as the daily recommendation, as it is based on the proper balance of caloric intake and activity-based caloric expenditure to maintain a healthy body (10 000 steps a day is supposed to burn around 300 calories).</p>

  <p>Fast-forward, and with the technological breakthroughs from smartphones such as iPhones and Android phones, we began to see as early as the early 2010s, devices which were until then, only used by professional athletes. Fitbit, Garmin, Jawbone, Apple and other brands started selling “Fitness Trackers”, or “Wearable activity trackers” as consumer-grade devices.</p>

<p>Today’s consumers are embracing wearable technologies and other activity-tracking products more than ever before. The omnipresence of smartphones has spawned a massive market for mobile health and wellness apps, focusing on various aspects of promoting wellness.</p>

<p class="quote text-center text-muted font-italic" cite="Verbatim from research">"Designing an appealing application is one thing, keeping its users motivated and committed in the long term, is a whole different story"</p>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>My teammate and I were approached by the Wellness Institute to explore how we could leverage technology to help people live a healthier life.</p>

  <p>They noticed that despite the vast availability of personal metrics and health apps, people continue to <strong>struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle</strong>. The goal of our app will be to help users support wellness, a term which has a very different meaning <strong>depending on the user awareness of his wellbeing</strong>: is it simply health in its holistic definition, is it related to fitness, sleep, diet, relationships, or hobbies only?</p>

  <p>Whatever activity contributes the most to one’s wellbeing, the app will need to be able to <strong>track the user’s progress</strong>. The wellness institute has made research and has evaluated progress-tracking to be a critical feature in order to push people towards commitment.</p>
</br>
  <h2>1. User Research</h2>
  <p>For our user research, we conducted a survey and have done 3 Jobs to be done to help us define our problem statement. As health and wellbeing are supposed to be a matter of concern for anyone, we made our survey with 10 questions, with most of the answers, providing quantitative data thanks to the Lickert scale. We wanted to understand what was causing this lack of commitment and see if there was an opportunity to design an app or feature which would help in that way.</p>

<p>We got 102 respondents* to our survey in just under two days. It was plenty enough and the 1st figure that struck us was that :</p>
</br>
  <figure>
      <img src="../assets/images/wellness/49.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
  </figure>
</br>
<p>Our users are health-conscious young adults, who are aware they should be taking care of their wellbeing, but still struggle to make some habits, a daily routine to life. What was interesting to notice was also the fact most of the respondents did have for the majority, spent some time with a “fitness buddy” at some point.</p>
</br>

</br>
<strong><p><h3>Do you have or used to have a fitness buddy?</p></h3></strong>
<figure>
    <img src="../assets/images/wellness/75.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
</figure>
<p>From those figures, it looks like having someone to exercise with is common, or has been common at some point. Since it was one of our assumptions, the survey had the following question :</p>
<h3>On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you think that having a Fitness buddy helps you find motivation?</h3>
<br>
<figure>
    <img src="../assets/images/wellness/5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
</figure>
<br>
<p>We can see that only 20% disagree, which almost 80% of the respondents answering how important having a fitness busy was helping them. To be more precise, 66% agreed or strongly agreed with that statement and 19% didn’t disagree nor did they agree.</p>
<br>
<strong>Those figures correlate perfectly with some statements from our job to be done interviews:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<p class="quote text-center text-muted font-italic" cite="Verbatim from research">"It’s way easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle when you have a fitness partner, because you both motivate each other"</p>
<br>
<br>
  <h2>2. Market Research</h2>
  <p>After consolidating our data from our survey, we needed more knowledge about wellness apps and how we could translate user needs into a functional mobile application.</p>
  <p>We started benchmarking the market and listed all major applications related to fitness, health, and wellbeing. After screening both the Apple Store and Google Play Store, we were beginning to have a good comprehension and a clear understanding of the different types of offers available on the market.</p>
  <p>My teammates and I spent countless hours downloading, testing, uninstalling quite “a lot” of almost quasi identical applications. After deciding to map out some major players from the market, we could position our future application on a matrix we created.</p>
  <br>
  <figure>
      <img src="../assets/images/wellness/competitors.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">X-axis: from left to right are the applications to be used alone, towards more social integration on the right. Y-axis: from top to bottom are the applications allowing multiple purposes, to single ask only applications (such as “petit bambou” or “calm” for instance)</figcaption>
  </figure>
<br>
<br>
<p>This competitor analysis map allowed us to identify our greatest challengers which are the five applications that have been labeled. Among them, we have positioned our future app in the upper right corner (it’s still nameless at the moment), making it a multi-purpose application with social features.</p>
<p>Thanks to this visual tool, we decided to benchmark our closest competitors a step further to see if we could highlight must-have features from our competitor. The purpose was to focus on bringing added value to our solution, in regards to existing apps.</p>
<br>
<figure>
    <img src="../assets/images/wellness/benchmark.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
</figure>
<br>
<p>Using this tool in such an easy way, listing the main/core features from those apps, we noticed that none of them combines all of the features at once, although 8fit was the most feature-rich application.</p>
<p>For us, it was very important to screen all the existing features so that we could list them and make assumptions to prepare for the ideation phase.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>To conclude this part of the study, we represented in a short SWOT analysis, what influences positively and negatively our solution with our product lunch in mind.</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
<br>
<p class="quote text-center text-muted font-italic" cite="Verbatim from research">“Recently health-conscious young adult needs a way to create his wellness plan, track his progress, and connect with friends to motivate each other to commit on the long-term because he wants to develop healthy habits to improve his wellness and start a new lifestyle.”</p>
<br>
<p>Our problem statement, which synthesizes our findings, highlights <strong>3 key ideas</strong> which we will focus on during the ideation phase :</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Users need to create their wellness plan</li>
  <li>Tracking progress over time is essential</li>
  <li>Connecting users with their friends or “wellness buddies” is key</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>The main goal is to keep our users committed in the long term and transform what are often short term resolutions, into lifelong habits.
</strong></p>

<h2>4. Ideation and feature priorization</h2>
<br>
<p>Our first workshops were “round robins”, and “worst possible idea”. As we have been mostly relying on our survey and several “jobs-to-be-done” during our user research, we needed to take a step back and try looking at the big picture. We had listed and been thinking of so many features for our app, that we needed a more lateral thinking method involving our users as much as we could.</p>
<p>The Workshops generated even more features and we were almost forgetting we were <strong>expected to deliver an MVP</strong> (Minimum viable product), and not a fully-featured application at the end of the 5 days sprint for this project.</p>
<p>We decided to organize feature prioritization workshops using the <strong>“MoSCoW Method”</strong> to select which features were must-have features for our users, thus, postponing any other features for later design and development.</p>
<br>
<p>After 6 workshops, we were getting consistent results from our users, and to our surprise, (and a bit of disappointment), the idea of having a wellness buddy didn’t make it to the list of “Must have” features, therefore, will be excluded from our MVP.</p>
<p>We synthesized what our users did consider the most important features to develop first, and those features can be summarized around two principles which are :</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Having Tailor-made workouts and programs</strong> according to his / her needs</li>
  <li><strong>Logging and tracking any physical activity</strong>, as well as tracking one’s water intake and calories, and being able to display these data as soon as there are enough to start seeing progress or improvements</li>
</ol>
